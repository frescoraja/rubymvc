#RubyMVC
##RubyMVC is a lightweight web application framework written in Ruby, inspired by Ruby on Rails. 
####Based on the MVC software architectural pattern and Active Record, RubyMVC allows you to run and host your own full stack web application! It runs on WEBrick server and constructs an ORM (object relational mapping) in Ruby from your database (either PostgreSQL or SQLite). Controller class handles HTTP requests and redirects, renders responses in HTML or ERB templates, and stores cookies and flash. Defines custom routes and associated HTTP methods. Router parses URI to determine correct path and query based on submitted parameters. Simple, lightweight, and functional!
