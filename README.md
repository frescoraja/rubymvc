#RubyMVC
##RubyMVC is a lightweight web application framework written in Ruby, inspired by Ruby on Rails. 
###Based on the MVC software architectural pattern and Active Record, this framework will build an Object Relational Mapping of a PostgreSQL RDBMS. Controller class handles HTTP requests and redirects, renders responses in HTML or ERB templates, and stores cookies and flash. Defines custom routes and associated HTTP methods, router parses URI to determine path, requested model(s), and can handle arbitrarily nested parameters. Runs on WEBrick server and interacts with both PostgreSQL and SQLite3 databases.
